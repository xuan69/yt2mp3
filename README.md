Dos CMD bat file to batch download Youtube videos to MP3 using YT-DLP and FFMPEG.

We will need to install YT-DL and FFMPEG, the easiest way to do this in windows is by using MSDos.

Open a CMD window, goto start button, type CMD and choose to **run COMMAND PROMPT** in MSDos window type

`winget install yt-dlp`

This will trigger two installs, type Y to agree to the T&C's of the software packages.

**Close the COMMAND PROMPT window**

Download the two files, one the batch file, **yt2mp3.bat**, and a blank file called **videos.txt**

yt2mp3.bat when executed will look for videos.txt and take all the Youtube URL links in this file and download them as MP3.
